To run this program ensure python is installed as well as the libraries, on your compiler:
- random
- sklearn
- matplot
- numpy
- pandas

Then run the command "python .\model.py". This trains the collaborative filtering model and runs the accuracy measure method to show the mean 
square error, percentage error and the mean absolute error.

After this command has been ran "python .\GUI.py" can be ran to run the GUI, which can be used to interact and query the model

It can take a few minutes for the model to train with the "python .\model.py". It also may take a few minutes for a trade recommendation to be 
generated
